# Folderr MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools to interact with Folderr's API, specifically for managing and communicating with Folderr Assistants.

## Installation

Add to your MCP Settings

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "folderr": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@folderr/folderr-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Features

The server provides the following tools:

### Authentication

Two methods of authentication are supported:

1. **Login with Email/Password**
   ```typescript
   {
     "name": "login",
     "arguments": {
       "email": "user@example.com",
       "password": "your-password"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **API Token Authentication**
   ```typescript
   {
     "name": "set_api_token",
     "arguments": {
       "token": "your-api-token"
     }
   }
   ```
   API tokens can be generated from the Folderr developers section. This method is recommended for automated or long-running processes.

### Assistant Management

1. **List Assistants**
   ```typescript
   {
     "name": "list_assistants",
     "arguments": {}
   }
   ```
   Returns a list of all available assistants for the authenticated user.

2. **Ask Assistant**
   ```typescript
   {
     "name": "ask_assistant",
     "arguments": {
       "assistant_id": "assistant-id",
       "question": "Your question here"
     }
   }
   ```
   Send a question to a specific assistant and receive their response.

## Configuration

The server stores its configuration in a `config.json` file, which includes:
- Base URL for the Folderr API
- Authentication token (from login or API key)

## Error Handling

The server provides detailed error messages for common scenarios:
- Authentication failures
- Invalid requests
- API errors
- Network issues

## Development

To build the server:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Usage in MCP Settings

Add the following to your MCP settings configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "folderr": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/folderr-server/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Authentication Flow

1. Either:
   - Use the `login` tool with email and password
   - Use the `set_api_token` tool with an API token from Folderr's developers section
2. The authentication token is automatically saved and used for subsequent requests
3. All assistant-related tools require authentication before use

## Error Messages

Common error messages and their meanings:
- "Not logged in": No authentication token is set
- "Login failed": Invalid credentials
- "Failed to list assistants": Error retrieving assistant list
- "Failed to ask assistant": Error sending question to assistant
